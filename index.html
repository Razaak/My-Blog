        <h3>What is this website About?</h3>
        <p>I got my first book on web design back in 1998. It was a square book with 'Learn HTML' written on it. I'm not sure where this book is now. About 8 years later i picked up "CSS3: The Missing Manual". This was a great book for learning the power of CSS.It would take another few years before I decided that web design might be an intersting career. And here I am, writing my first Blog. Amazing Huh?</p>
        <h3>Time is on my side</h3>
